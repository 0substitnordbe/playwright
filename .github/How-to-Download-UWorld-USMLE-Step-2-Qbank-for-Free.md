However, there are some ways to get UWorld USMLE Step 2 Qbank for free, or at least for a discounted price. Here are some of them:
 
- Use a free trial. UWorld offers a 7-day free trial for their Step 2 CK Qbank, which gives you access to over 2,000 questions and detailed explanations. You can sign up for the free trial on their website and start practicing right away. You can also download the PDF files of the questions and answers during the trial period.
- Use a coupon code. UWorld occasionally offers coupon codes and discounts for their products, especially during special occasions like holidays or exam seasons. You can check their social media pages or online forums for any available coupon codes and apply them at checkout to save some money.
- Use a shared account. UWorld allows you to share your account with up to two other users, as long as you do not log in at the same time. This means you can split the cost of the subscription with your friends or classmates and access the Qbank from different devices. However, this option may violate UWorld's terms of service, so use it at your own risk.
- Use a torrent site. Some users upload UWorld PDF files to torrent sites or file-sharing platforms, where you can download them for free. However, this option is illegal and unethical, as it infringes UWorld's copyright and intellectual property rights. Moreover, the PDF files may be outdated, incomplete, or infected with malware.
